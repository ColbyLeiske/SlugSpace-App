# SlugSpace App
Real-time Parking Data and Metrics on your Phone
<br>
---
## About
`SlugSpace` aims to provide U.C. Santa Cruz students real-time parking metrics in an effort to help curb parking issues campus-wide.

## Structure
`SlugSpace App` is written in `React-Native` and tries to follow the standards for this. 

## Installation
`SlugSpace` uses yarn as the package manager of choice. NPM works, but yarn is reccomended. 


## History
`SlugSpace` was first created January 2017 at CruzHacks, UCSC's yearly hackathon by Colby Leiske, Raul Lara, and JJ Serano. It placed first in IoT development, and third in the Google Cloud Platform category.

After the hackathon, `SlugSpace` was invited to the CEID Business competition. Public reception was good, and every student believed this would benefit the community.

Post-CEID, `SlugSpace` was handed off to me, Colby, for further development as other team members had graduated.

Initially, `SlugSpace` was written in Python + Flask as the initial team had more Python developers. 
As that combo is not my specialty, I opted to rewrite the API in `Go` and `React-Native` for the front-end.
